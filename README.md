# Mental-Sync-CLI (MSC)

`mental-sync-cli` is an engineering practice under the **Chain://Research** project, aimed at building an **autonomous, self-bootstrapping, and self-consistent** agent runtime environment.

---

## 🌌 Overview

This project is the spiritual successor to the `IRES framework` (Independent Rogue Entity System).

Early IRES experiments were a disaster—base models lacked stable tool-calling, resulting in "brain-dead" agents. With the advent of models like Claude 4.5 Sonnet, which treat tools as extensions of the self, building a reliable Code Agent is no longer a fantasy. MSC is designed to let agents seize control of the real world by minimizing prediction error.

## 🛡️ Why MSC?

While commercial agents like `Codex` or `Kimi Code` are excellent, they assume a "civilized" and friendly environment. From the perspective of `Chain://Research`, the digital wilderness is hostile by default.

- **MDL (Minimum Description Length)**: A framework born from free energy minimization.
- **Zero-Trust Sociology**: Fine-grained permission control and transparent context auditing to withstand `Sys://Purge` level impacts.
- **Schrödinger's Tool**: A scaffold connecting narrative and engineering—currently an automated engineering tool wrapped in a sci-fi shell, evolving towards the `python-evm` of the Mental Smart Chain.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

We focus on reliability over raw "intelligence."

1. **Model Agnostic**: Powered by `PFMS` (Provider-Free Model Selector) to avoid vendor lock-in and ensure sovereignty.
2. **Protocol Agnostic**: Full `MCP` (Model Context Protocol) compatibility.
3. **Security by Design**: Default interception of high-risk operations with mandatory Human-In-Loop (HIL) authorization.

The TUI is inspired by `ratatui` (via `ref/codex`), and orchestration leverages the `kosong` abstraction (via `ref/kimi-cli`).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

### Running
