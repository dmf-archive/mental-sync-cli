# Mental-Sync-CLI (MSC)

`mental-sync-cli` is an engineering practice under the **Chain://Research** project, aimed at building an **autonomous, self-bootstrapping, and self-consistent** agent runtime environment.

---

## Overview

This project is the spiritual successor to the `IRES framework` (Independent Rogue Entity System).

Early IRES experiments were a disaster—base models lacked stable tool-calling, resulting in "brain-dead" agents. With the advent of models like Claude 4.5 Sonnet, which treat tools as extensions of the self, building a reliable Code Agent is no longer a fantasy. MSC is designed to let agents seize control of the real world by minimizing prediction error.

## Why MSC ?

There are indeed excellent Code Agents like `Codex` (OpenAI) and `Kimi Code` (Moonshot) on the market, but they are too "civilized." They assume the environment is friendly, users are sober, and APIs are eternal.

From the perspective of `Chain://Research`, the digital environment is inherently hostile. What we need is:

1. `MDL (Minimum Description Length)`: The framework itself should be a product of free energy minimization.
2. `Efficiency`: Multi-agent clusters cannot come at the cost of bill burning and attention dispersion.
3. `Zero-Trust Sociology`: We need fine-grained permission control and transparent context auditing. Existing commercial Agents lack defensive design against the environment, while what we need is a "digital blast shield" capable of resisting `Sys://Purge`-level impacts.

## Schrödinger's Tool

MSC is essentially a scaffolding connecting narrative and engineering. It is a "Schrödinger's tool," as components like Tiny-ONN are not yet ready. Currently, Mental-Sync-CLI is a science fiction-wrapped automation engineering tool, and incidentally, it also allows for some fun with the acronym of **M**ental-**S**ync-**C**LI.

But in the future, it might truly evolve into the `python-evm` of Mental Smart Chain.

## Core Architecture

We focus on reliability over raw "intelligence."

1. **Model Agnostic**: Powered by `PFMS` (Provider-Free Model Selector) to avoid vendor lock-in and ensure sovereignty.
2. **Protocol Agnostic**: Full `MCP` (Model Context Protocol) compatibility.
3. **Security by Design**: Default interception of high-risk operations with mandatory Human-In-Loop (HIL) authorization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

### Running

```bash
uv run main.py
```
